# Introduction  

## Online News Popularity Data Set  
With the unending developments of the internet, more and more people have access to online news articles. When people enjoys the article they read, they tend to share them through their social media accounts. Thus, the popularity of these articles can be associated to the number of times they are shared. In this project, we intend to find the best model that predicts the popularity of the online news using different techniques we learned in class.  

The online news popularity data set that we will use is taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data comes from a popular online news [Mashable]('www.mashable.com'). There are 39644 articles, 58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive and 1 goal field.


## Descriptions of Variables  
As mentioned, there are 58 predictors and 1 response variables in the data set. Thus, there is a need to select the most important predictor variables to reduce noise in the model. Ren and Young (2015) of Stanford University in their [report]('http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/328_report.pdf') used different ways to reduce such variables. Fisher criterion determined the top 20 predictors. In this project, we are adapting their method and using the variables they found more discriminative, see figure below.  

```{r fscores, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("top20.png")
```   

But since we are reporting by type of channel, then we can only use 16 perdictor variables for channel variables will become irrelevant. Below is the list of variables that we will use and their corresponding descriptions.  

1. kw_avg_avg: Avg. keyword (avg. shares)  
2. LDA_02: Closeness to LDA topic 2  
3. is_weekend: Was the article published on the weekend?  
4. weekday_is_saturday: Was the article published on a Saturday?  
5. LDA_04: Closeness to LDA topic 4  
6. kw_max_avg: Avg. keyword (max. shares)  
7. weekday_is_sunday: Was the article published on a Sunday?  
8. LDA_00: Closeness to LDA topic 0  
9. num_hrefs: Number of links  
10. global_subjectivity: Text subjectivity  
11. kw_min_avg: Avg. keyword (min. shares)  
12. global_sentiment_polarity: Text sentiment polarity  
13. rate_negative_words: Rate of negative words among non-neutral tokens  
14. kw_min_min: Worst keyword (min. shares)  
15. title_subjectivity: Title subjectivity  
16. LDA_01: Closeness to LDA topic 1  

The response variable that we will try to predict using predictibe models will be:
17. shares: Number of shares (target)  


## Purpose and Methods  

In this project, we aim to find the best model among two linear regressions, random forest and  boosted tree model. Cross validation will be used in choosing the best model with the optimal tuning parameters. Lastly, all four models will be compared on the test set based on misclassification and accuracy rates.  


# Data  
## Reading in the Data  
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# read in data set
data <- read_csv('OnlineNewsPopularity.csv') %>% dplyr::select(-c(url,timedelta))

# subset data set by channel (in this case channel=entertainment)
# when we change the channel parameter, this data set will also change
chanVar <- as.name(paste0("data_channel_is_", params$channel))
chanData <- data %>% filter((!!sym(chanVar)) == 1)
```

## Filtering and Splitting Data
```{r}
#set seed and variables to use
set.seed(2)
variables <- c(6,18,24:26,35:39,40,42:44,48,55,59)

#split data set
index <- createDataPartition(chanData$shares, p=0.7, list=F)
train <- chanData[index, variables]
test <- chanData[-index, variables]

```

# Summarizations  

## Number of Channels
In this portion, we will look at the number of different channels in the data set.
```{r}
#generate dataframe of channels and its frequency
channels <- data[,c(12:17)]
counts <- data.frame(Channel = c("Lifestyle","Entertainment","Business","Social Media",
                                 "Technology", "World"), Frequency = colSums(channels))

#generate a contingency table
rownames(counts) <- NULL
kable(counts)

#generate a plot 
ggplot(counts, aes(x=Channel, y=Frequency)) + geom_col(fill="light blue") + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Channels") + geom_text(aes(label=Frequency))


```
We can see from both contingency table and bar plot that the World Channel has the highest number of articles while Lifestyle Channel has the lowest number of articles.


## Numeric Summaries
We will only look at the five number summaries of the predictors with the top 5 highest Fisher scores. We will also include the response variable `shares`.
```{r}
sumVars <- c(5, 11, 8, 6, 12, 17)
kable(summary(train[,sumVars]))
```
These summaries show measures of center (mean and median) and measures of spread (quantiles, min and max) for each variable.

## Correlations
```{r}
correlation <- cor(train)
correlation %>% corrplot()
```
Looking at the plot above, the size and color of the circle indicate how strong the correlation between two variables are. The darker the blue is, the more positively correlated they are. While the darker the red is, the more negatively correlated the variables will be.

We can show scatterplots of some of the pairs of variables such as `kw_avg_avg: Avg. keyword (avg. shares)` & `kw_max_avg: Avg. keyword (max. shares)` and  `rate_negative_words: Rate of negative words among non-neutral tokens` & `global_sentiment_polarity: Text sentiment polarity`.  
```{r}
#generate scatterplot of `kw_avg_avg` & `kw_max_avg``
cor1 <- round(cor(train$kw_avg_avg, train$kw_max_avg), 3)
ggplot(train, aes(kw_avg_avg, kw_max_avg)) + geom_point(color="blue") +
  geom_text(x = 20000, y=1e+05, label= paste0("Correlation=", cor1), color="red") +
    labs(title="Avg. Keyword (avg. shares) vs Avg. Keyword (max. shares) Plot",
       x="Avg. Keyword (avg. shares)", y="Avg. Keyword (max. shares)") 

#generate scatterplot of `rate_negative_words` & `global_sentiment_polarity`
cor2 <- round(cor(train$rate_negative_words, train$global_sentiment_polarity), 3)
ggplot(train, aes(rate_negative_words, global_sentiment_polarity)) + geom_point(color="blue") +
  geom_text(x = 0.75, y=0.5, label= paste0("Correlation=", cor2), color="red") +
    labs(title="Rate Negative Words vs Global Sentiment Polarity Plot",
       x="Rate Negative Words", y="Global Sentiment Polarity") 
```

To Daniel: I think we can add more plots especially those related to shares.
