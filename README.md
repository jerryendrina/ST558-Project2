## Purpose

In this repo, we analyze the rate at which certain news articles are shared, attempting to learn more about why some articles are shared more than others. We were especially interested in how this differed across six news categories: Lifestyle, Entertainment, Business, Social Media, Techonology, and World. 

To answer these questions, we first explore the data through plots and summary tables. Then, we build linear regression, random forest, and boosted tree models that predict how many times an article got shared based on 16 different inputs. Through these models, we learn how well the number of shares can be predicted, as well as which inputs lead to more shares.

## R Packages

In this project, we use several open-source packages:

- `{rmarkdown}`: Render new .Rmd files
- `{tidyverse}`: Collection of data wrangling & visualization packages
- `{caret}`: For model building
- `{knitr}`:
- `{corrplot}`: Correlation plot
- `{leaps}`:
- `{here}`: Access files from current working directory with `here::here()`
- `{kableExtra}`: Tables
- `{scales}`: Number formatting for tables and plots
- `{ggpubr}`: Correlation coefficient on plots

## Links

To create links to files, just reference the relative path. E.g. if we output the html
files in the main directory can reference [this file](xyz.html)

## Code to Create Analyses

Just the exact code from `project2.Rmd`, I'm assuming...
